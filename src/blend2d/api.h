//! \mainpage API Reference
//!
//! Blend2D C/C++ API reference documentation generated by Doxygen.
//!
//! \section main_introduction Introduction
//!
//! Blend2D API consists of enumerations, functions, structs, and C++ classes.
//! Common concepts like enumerations and POD structs are shared between C and
//! C++. Some structs contain extra functionality like `BLSomething::reset()`
//! that is only available to C++ users, however, such functionality is only
//! provided for convenience and doesn't affect how Blend2D can be used from C.
//!
//! Blend2D C++ API is in fact build on top of the C API and all C++ functions
//! are inlines that call C API without any overhead. It would require double
//! effort to document both C and C++ APIs separately so we have decided to only
//! document C++ API and to only list \ref blend2d_api_c_functions "C API" for
//! users that need it. The C API should be straightforward and matches very
//! well the C++ part.
//!
//! \section main_important Important
//!
//! Doxygen sorts struct members in anonymous structs and unions and we haven't
//! figured out how to turn this off. This means that the order of members in
//! "Public Attributes" doesn't have to reflect the original struct packing.
//! So please always double-check struct members in case you plan to use
//! braces-based initialization of simple structs.
//!
//! \section main_groups Groups
//!
//! The documentation is split into the following groups:
//!
//! $$DOCS_GROUP_OVERVIEW$$

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_globals Global API
//! \brief Global functions, constants,  and classes used universally across
//! the library.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_geometry Geometry API
//! \brief Geometries, paths, and transformations.
//!
//! Blend2D offers various geometry structures and objects that can be used with
//! either `BLPath` for path building or `BLContext` for rendering.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_imaging Imaging API
//! \brief Images and image codecs.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_styling Styling API
//! \brief Colors, gradients, and patterns.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_text Text API
//! \brief Fonts & Text support.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_rendering Rendering API
//! \brief 2D rendering context, helper structures, and constants.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_runtime Runtime API
//! \brief Interaction with Blend2D runtime.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_filesystem Filesystem API
//! \brief Filesystem utilities.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_impl Impl API
//! \brief API required for extending Blend2D functionality.
//!
//! Everything that is part of this group requires `<blend2d-impl.h>` to be
//! included before the use as this API is only for users that extend Blend2D.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_macros Macros
//! \brief Preprocessor macros and compile-time constants.

//! \defgroup blend2d_api_c_functions C API
//! \brief Global C API functions exported as `extern "C"` (C API).
//!
//! We do not document these functions as they are called from C++ wrappers,
//! which are documented and should be used as a reference. The most important
//! thing in using C API is to understand how lifetime of objects is managed.
//!
//! Each type that requires initialization provides `Init`, 'Destroy', and `Reset`
//! functions. Init/Destroy are called by C++ constructors and destructors on C++
//! side and must be used the same way by C users. Although these functions return
//! `BLResult` it's guaranteed the result is always `BL_SUCCESS` - the return
//! value is only provided for consistency and possible tail calling.
//!
//! The following example should illustrate how `Init` and `Destroy` works:
//!
//! ```
//! BLImageCore img;
//! blImageInit(&img);
//! blImageCreate(&img, 128, 128, BL_FORMAT_PRGB32);
//! blImageDestroy(&img);
//! ```
//!
//! Some init functions may provide shortcuts for the most used scenarios that
//! merge initialization and resource allocation into a single function:
//!
//! ```
//! BLImageCore img;
//! blImageInitAs(&img, 128, 128, BL_FORMAT_PRGB32);
//! blImageDestroy(&img);
//! ```
//!
//! It's worth knowing that default initialization in Blend2D costs nothing
//! and no resources are allocated, thus initialization never fails and in
//! theory default initialized objects don't have to be destroyed as they don't
//! hold any data that would have to be deallocated (however never do that in
//! practice).
//!
//! There is a distinction between 'Destroy' and 'Reset' functionality. Destroy
//! would destroy the object and put it into a non-reusable state. Thus if the
//! object is used by accident it should crash on null-pointer access. In the
//! contrary resetting  the object with 'Reset' explicitly states that the
//! instance will be reused so 'Reset' basically destroys the object and puts
//! it into its default initialized state for further use. This means that it's
//! not needed to explicitly call 'Destroy' on instance that was reset, and it
//! also is not needed for a default constructed instance. However, we recommend
//! to not count on this behavior and to always properly initialize and destroy
//! Blend2D objects.
//!
//! The following example should explain how init/reset can avoid destroy:
//!
//! \code
//! BLImageCore img;
//!
//! // Now image is default constructed/initialized. if you did just this and
//! // abandon it then no resources will be leaked as default construction is
//! // not allocating any resources nor increasing any reference counters.
//! blImageInit(&img);
//!
//! // Now image will have to dynamically allocate some memory to store pixel
//! // data. If this succeeds the image will have to be reset to destroy the
//! // data it holds.
//! BLResult result = blImageCreate(&img, 128, 128, BL_FORMAT_PRGB32);
//!
//! // If function fails it should behave like it was never called, so `img`
//! // would still be default initialized in this case. this means that you
//! // don't have to destroy it explicitly although the C++ API would do it in
//! // BLImage destructor.
//! if (result != BL_SUCCESS)
//!   return result;
//!
//! // Resetting image would destroy its data and make it default constructed.
//! blImageReset(&img);
//!
//! // You can still use the image after it has been reset, however, since the
//! // image is default initialized it's empty.
//! printf("%p", img.impl);
//!
//! // The instance is still valid, to make it invalid we can destroy it for good.
//! blImageDestroy(&img);
//!
//! // At the moment null will be printed, but that's implementation dependent
//! // and such behavior can change at any time.
//! printf("%p", img.impl);

//! from WIN32 or POSIX APIs. Since the success result code is zero it's
//! recommended to use the following check to determine whether a call failed

//! ```
