//! Flags that are used by the vectorized outline decoder implementation.
//!
//! Most of the flags are the same as flags used in TT outlines, however, the following modifications were made in
//! order to make the implementation faster:
//!
//!   1. XByte|YByte|XSame|YSame flags were moved to [3:0] bits so they can be used as a predicate with VPSHUFB
//!      instruction. These 4 bits are the only important bits to decode X/Y vertices.
//!   2. XSameOrPositive and YSameOrPositive flags were negated. After negation when all [3:0] bits are zero, the
//!      vertex is zero as well. This is required when processing multiple flags at once at the end. Extra flags
//!      in a loop that processes 8 or 16 flags at a time are zero, thus they don't contribute to X/Y data lengths.
//!   3. OnCurve flag and its complement flag (OffCurve) are stored next to each other. When these flags are shifted
//!      to [1:0] bits they represent either `BL_PATH_CMD_ON` or `BL_PATH_CMD_QUAD` commands, which is handy in the
//!      last loop that appends vertices.
//!   4. Additional OffSpline flag is a combination of OffCurve flag with previous OffCurve flag. If both were set
//!      then this flag would have OffSpline set as well. This is important for counting how many off-curve splines
//!      are in the data, and later in the last loop to check whether we are in off curve spline or not.
//!   5. Repeat flag is last so we can use VPMOVMSKB instruction to quickly check for repeated flags.
